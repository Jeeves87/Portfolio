# Portfolio.io

This is my main portfolio/project page for Code Louisville. It currently consists of a main page, index.html, with further projects or tutorials I found interesting and hopefully revealing of the kind of programmer I desire to be.
The linked projects are the result of following tutorials and other follow-along style educational videos that I have either improved, fixed, or manipulated in some way.
