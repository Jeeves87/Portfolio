# Portfolio.io

This is my main portfolio/project page for Code Louisville. It currently consists of a main page, index.html, and several other pages I have done follow along tutorials on. index.html should meet all requirements by itself. The other pages are the result of lessons I have followed on youtube for educational purposes.
box.html is from following Kevin Powell and Amit Sheens
The linked projects are the result of following tutorials and other follow-along style educational videos that I have either improved, fixed, or manipulated in some way.
